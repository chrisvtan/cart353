Assignment 1 - 50 concepts

Due 17-01-2017

The Task

The first idea you have is unlikely to be your best one. So I want you to come up with 50 ideas that could inform the directions of your final project. You are to come up with these ideas individually.

Each of these ideas should describe a potential creative computational concept, and should approximately detail:

    what the "thing" is (toy, game, experience)
    what the computational aspect is and/or
    qualities of the intended experience
