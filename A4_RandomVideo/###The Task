###The Task

Drawing on techniques presented in the Introduction chapter of Nature of Code and Chapter 16 of Learning Processing, create a program that:

* Uses Gaussian distribution or a Montecarlo algorithm
* Uses 2D or 3D Perlin noise
* Acts on a video (live or pre-recorded)

You can also include any other visuals of your choice. (Or not.)

The result doesn't need to be beautiful. In fact, I'd like you to embrace the world of Internet Ugly: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1470412914544516
