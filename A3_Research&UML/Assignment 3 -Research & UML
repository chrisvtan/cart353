Assignment 3 - UML diagram

The Task

By now you should have settled on one concept. It may be one of the 50 you detailed in your assignment, or it may be a merging of several concepts, or it may be based on something else entirely. The important thing is: you have one concept.

For this assignment, you are to research this concept to better understand what exactly it is, what has already been done, and how you might bring it to life computationally. Prepare a presentation of max. 5 minutes to share with the class where you outline:

    what your concept is
    what your research sources and inspirations are (have clear citations as your classmates may want to follow them up)
    similar work by other artists
    your project scope â€” how you will keep it to a manageable size
    your current best guess as how to computationally model components of the concept based on your research
    a UML diagram explaining your current plan for how you will build your project
